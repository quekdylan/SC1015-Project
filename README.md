## Problem 
In the dynamic automotive market, traditional methods of estimating vehicle prices often overlook crucial factors such as condition, mileage, and brand, leading to inaccurate valuations
  
## Goal    
Our aim is to develop a more accurate and reliable pricing tool by analyzing past vehicle sales transactions, providing valuable insights to buyers
